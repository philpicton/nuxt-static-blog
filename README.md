# Nuxt powered static developer blog template

> Using Nuxt3, Tailwind css, Nuxt Content, Cloudflare Pages, and a Cloudflare Function

This project is designed to be deployed as a static website to Cloudflare Pages

For detailed setup and installation instructions for this project, check out this [series of blog posts](https://philpicton.dev/blog/how-to-build-a)

PRs and issues are welcome if something isn't working, but I'm not looking to add new features, the blog posts are long enough already!
